# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Anomaly Detection

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions by identifying anomalies in financial transaction data. The project employs machine learning techniques such as Isolation Forests and Autoencoders to effectively detect and analyze anomalies.

## Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project leverages advanced machine learning models to detect anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activities. By analyzing transaction data, the model identifies patterns and flags transactions that deviate significantly from the norm, allowing for early detection of potential fraud.

## Features
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** The project identifies anomalies in transaction data, enabling quick action to prevent potential fraud.
- **Transaction Analysis:** Provides detailed insights into transaction amounts over time, highlighting anomalies for further investigation.
- **Visualization:** Includes visual representations of detected anomalies, showing their distribution over time and by transaction amount.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For data processing and model implementation.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow/Keras:** For implementing machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## Steps Involved

### Data Collection:
The project begins with the collection of a large dataset containing anonymized credit card transaction records. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and includes features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized data obtained through PCA.

### Data Preprocessing:
The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize transaction amounts, and prepare the data for model training. This step ensures that the data is clean and ready for analysis.

### Model Implementation:
Multiple machine learning models are implemented to detect anomalies within the transaction data. These models are trained to identify patterns that deviate significantly from the norm, which could indicate fraudulent activity.

### Model Evaluation:
The models are evaluated based on their performance in detecting anomalies. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, F1 scores, and visual representations of confusion matrices to understand model performance.

### Visualization:
The project includes various visualizations that depict the distribution of anomalies over time and by transaction amount. These visual insights help to understand the patterns and trends associated with fraudulent transactions.

## Business Impact: How This Model Can Be Used in a Real-World Setting to Different Financial Organisations and Firms

### Real-Time Fraud Detection:
By deploying this anomaly detection model in production, PayPal can monitor transactions in real-time and flag potentially fraudulent activities. As soon as a transaction is processed, the model can evaluate it based on the trained patterns and determine whether it appears to be fraudulent or not.

### Risk Scoring and Alerts:
The anomalies detected by the model can be assigned risk scores. Higher scores could indicate a higher probability of fraud. This scoring system can be used to prioritize transactions that need immediate investigation by PayPal’s fraud detection team.

### Automated Blocking of Transactions:
For transactions flagged with a high anomaly score, PayPal could automatically block or pause the transaction pending further review. This would prevent fraudulent transactions from being processed, thus protecting users from financial losses.

### Enhanced Customer Trust:
Implementing an advanced fraud detection system like this one can enhance customer trust, knowing that their transactions are being monitored for safety. This could reduce chargebacks and fraud-related losses, which are costly for financial institutions.

### Continuous Improvement:
The model can be continuously retrained on new data, adapting to new patterns of fraudulent behavior as they emerge. This adaptability is crucial in staying ahead of increasingly sophisticated fraud attempts.

## Future Prospects

### Continuous Model Improvement:
The model can be updated regularly with new transaction data to learn from emerging fraud patterns, ensuring that it remains effective over time. This continuous learning process helps in adapting to evolving fraudulent strategies.

### Integration with Other Security Measures:
This model can be integrated with other security systems, such as two-factor authentication or behavioral biometrics, to provide a multi-layered defense against fraud.

### Expansion to Other Financial Services:
While the current model is focused on credit card transactions, it can be adapted to monitor other types of financial transactions, such as wire transfers or digital wallet payments, expanding its utility across various financial services.

## Conclusions
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project successfully demonstrates the application of anomaly detection techniques in identifying fraudulent transactions. The use of machine learning models like Isolation Forests and Autoencoders provides a robust solution for detecting anomalies in financial data. The project highlights the importance of real-time fraud detection to minimize financial losses and enhance transaction security.
