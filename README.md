# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Anomaly Detection

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions by identifying anomalies in financial transaction data. The project employs machine learning techniques such as Isolation Forests and Autoencoders to effectively detect and analyze anomalies.

## Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project leverages advanced machine learning models to detect anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activities. By analyzing transaction data, the model identifies patterns and flags transactions that deviate significantly from the norm, allowing for early detection of potential fraud.

## Features
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** The project identifies anomalies in transaction data, enabling quick action to prevent potential fraud.
- **Transaction Analysis:** Provides detailed insights into transaction amounts over time, highlighting anomalies for further investigation.
- **Visualization:** Includes visual representations of detected anomalies, showing their distribution over time and by transaction amount.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For data processing and model implementation.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow/Keras:** For implementing machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## Steps Involved

### Data Collection:
The project begins with the collection of a large dataset containing anonymized credit card transaction records. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and includes features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized data obtained through PCA.

### Data Preprocessing:
The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize transaction amounts, and prepare the data for model training. This step ensures that the data is clean and ready for analysis.

### Model Implementation:
Multiple machine learning models are implemented to detect anomalies within the transaction data. These models are trained to identify patterns that deviate significantly from the norm, which could indicate fraudulent activity.

### Model Evaluation:
The models are evaluated based on their performance in detecting anomalies. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, F1 scores, and visual representations of confusion matrices to understand model performance.

### Visualization:
The project includes various visualizations that depict the distribution of anomalies over time and by transaction amount. These visual insights help to understand the patterns and trends associated with fraudulent transactions.

## Conclusions
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project successfully demonstrates the application of anomaly detection techniques in identifying fraudulent transactions. The use of machine learning models like Isolation Forests and Autoencoders provides a robust solution for detecting anomalies in financial data. The project highlights the importance of real-time fraud detection to minimize financial losses and enhance transaction security.
